      <p>The Hacking Chinese Challenge Engine was created to stimulate and encourage language learning by allowing you to set personal goals and strive to achieve them alongside fellow students. With a clear goal in sight and a defined period of time, procrastination is kept to a minimum and focus remains high. The challenges here are meant to be cooperative where we strive towards similar goals together, providing each other with moral support and inspiration. Any competitive element should be friendly in nature!</p>
