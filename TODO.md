## Resources migration

* Unit challenge view not good
*  Can you reply to someone's comment or is the comment system flat? I think both work, but in any case, it might be good to have a "reply" button (perhaps another speech bubble like the one you already have) next to comments left by other users.
* I think you mentioned that it should be easier to see recent activity, but I'm not sure how to do that (if it's implemented). I can see others activity by clicking on their profiles, but very few people are likely to ever do that. I think you mentioned making some kind of shared activity page the default page for challenges (or something).
* "Login" is always visible iat the top, even if you're already logged in.
* Unit Type CRUD

* Non Function
  * Info Mail/BlogPost
